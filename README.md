The dataset used in this analysis contains various features related to employment, such as age, education level, job sector, and economic indicators. This data is used to train and test the classification models.
The dataset can be found in the  directory of the project.

Models
In this project, we will compare the following classification models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model will be evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix

These metrics will help us understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model in predicting unemployment.

Results
The results section will include a detailed comparison of the models based on the evaluation metrics mentioned above.
Visualizations, such as graphs and charts, will be included to illustrate the performance differences between models.

Conclusion
This analysis aims to identify the most effective classification model for predicting unemployment. The insights gained from this project can be valuable for policymakers, economists, and job seekers to understand trends and make informed decisions.
